NOT FOR AGU
- input
- OBJ is the current format
- useful to have a binary format for triangular mesh? [low priority]
- useful to allow loading “DEM”, that is arrays of x/y/z positions which are of size NxM; turn that into triangular mesh with implicit cutting into triangles [low priority]
- visibility methods (67P bug), hybrid version?
- investigate embree?
  - build BVH with SAH? (not the same, but this does parallel Kd-tree with SAH: https://github.com/bchoi/ParKD) [real gain expected?]
  - does it make sense to use “ray packets” to get direct illumination state (at each timestep), given small source (e.g., Sun; not Mars from Phobos) [may speed up direct illum]
- culling based on location/pointing of two faces: possible to extend to triangle groups (e.g., work at higher-level bounding boxes with a octree kind of thing)
- throw a warning when building horizon map
- BRDF with multi-pass treatment?
- O(N) direct method
  - given N nodes, reorder vertices to find optimal clustering to split and reduce comm between nodes
- evaluate/step it with finer timestep than direct illumination? [may not make any difference if dt small enough]
  - Erwan will talk to Norbert first
- think about implementing sources like Mars (reflection of sunlight;
  thermal emission of its own): separately like sunlight currently, or
  as moving triangular meshes with own albedo/emission?
- running sum of light contributions from every point to every other
  point---dump it at the end of the run? (an idea---need to check)
- try better form factors?

FOR AGU
- read in external file with initial state for thermal model (e.g.,
  from checkpoint or last output from previous run): both parameters
  (static: TI, etc.) and values (whole-profile temperature)
- dump the entire thermal model and be able to read in the entire
  thermal model
  - human readable nice?
- *bootstrapping thermal*---send Erwan a script to run it
- *GPU: optimize the horizon map lookup using min/max or some other tricks*
- would be good to allow user selection of outputs: for each of a
  number of fields (illumination, surface temperature, whole-profile
  temperature), give temporal frequency (every timestep, modulo N,
  avg/max/min, input list of timestep indices, last N), and perhaps
  which subset of points to output (list of indices; default: all)
- flexible naming for output e.g. "file.dat" overwrites, "file*.dat"
  writes w/ format for time step---this allows check-pointing
- *two different OBJs* for crater

GOAL
- comparison of convergences for Vesta and Ceres in bootstrapping
  thermal model---do they converge with different rates?

MAYBE FOR AGU
- intel MKL for:
  - MPI
  - allow inversion with MPI
  - allow direct illumination with MPI ? (if it makes sense given everything needs to be re communicated)

THINGS I NEED FROM ERWAN
- a sequence of sun positions for Ceres and Vesta
