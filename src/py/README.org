*Python Scripts*

This directory contains a variety of Python scripts which are described below.

Each of these Python scripts depends on Python 3---please make sure
you aren't using Python 2 when running these scripts.

*~render_frames.py~*

This application can be used to render frames of different data
generated by ~illum_cli~ which can be fed into ffmpeg later to create
videos visualizing ~illum_cli~'s output.
