** Compiling

   The C++ sources are all in ~src/cpp~, and the build system is
   CMake. To build to command-line programs, it's best to do an
   out-of-source build using CMake; i.e., to have CMake build and
   store temporary files in a directory different from ~src/cpp~. This
   can be any directory.

   To compile using the directory ~build~ for an out-of-source build,
   run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_TBB=ON ../src/cpp
make -j 4
#+END_SRC
