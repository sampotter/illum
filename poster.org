** Limitations

* Figures to add

  - average illumination of vesta (for the "discontinuous sun pos")
  - scattered radiosity
  - thermal: max, avg, and difference due to radiosity
  - oscillatory figure

* Todo

  - add thermal emissivity
  - try bootstrapping thermal model
  - try G-S initialized from previous step
  - try G-S initialized from upsampled result
  - Southwell
  - precompute mesh transfer data structure
